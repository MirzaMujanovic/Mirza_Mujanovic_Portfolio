My name is Mirza Mujanović, I am an ever-curious, eager to learn and ready to adapt student in his third semester of Marketing master program at the Vienna University of Economics and Business. Originally, I come from Tuzla, Bosnia & Herzegovina, where I finished high school and first two semesters at the Faculty of Economics. In 2015, I moved to Vienna to study, and in 2019 completed a bachelor’s program in business administration at the Vienna University of Economics and Business (WU) in 2019. Currently, I hold a part-time position of teaching and eLearning assistant at the WU. Thinking of my future plans I see myself working in the field of data analytics or data science for marketing.
