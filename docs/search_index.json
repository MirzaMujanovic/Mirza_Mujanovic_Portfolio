[["index.html", "Who I am?", " Who I am? My name is Mirza Mujanovi, I am an ever-curious, eager to learn and ready to adapt student in his third semester of Marketing master program at the Vienna University of Economics and Business. Originally, I come from Tuzla, Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina, where I finished high school and first two semesters at the Faculty of Economics. In 2015, I moved to Vienna to study, and in 2019 completed a bachelors program in business administration at the Vienna University of Economics and Business (WU) in 2019. Currently, I hold a part-time position of teaching and eLearning assistant at the WU. Thinking of my future plans I see myself working in the field of data analytics or data science for marketing.

With the expansion and availability of the Internet, online consumer reviews have become a valuable resource to look at. Several studies tried to demystify relationship between product sales and online customer reviews. On the one hand, some of them, such as Senecal and Nantel (2004), suggest that participants who consulted product recommendations selected these products twice as often as those who did not consult recommendations. On the other hand, Zhang and Dellarocas (2006) find that online reviews and do not influence sales and serve solely as prediction. Between these two opinion fronts, one thing is certain: both sides aim to find out how consumers perceive and process word-of-mouth in a digital environment. In the academic paper The Role of Emotions for the Perceived Usefulness in Online Customer Reviews authors suggests that emotions impact the helpfulness ratings, i.e., the quality of online reviews as perceived by other customers. They found that, on average, the most prominent emotion dimensions that influence helpfulness ratings are trust, joy, and anticipation. Inspired by these findings, I decided to apply natural language processing techniques to analyze online customer reviews of a bestselling product on Amazon and try to detect those emotions using available lexicons. Final insights will show us whether trust, joy and anticipation can be identified in the reviews, thus improve helpfulness of reviews for potential customers. What to expect in this article? First, I will extract text via web-scrapping and form a corpus. Next, the text in the corpus will be pre-processed. Subsequently, from the pre-processed text will be stored in form of document-term-matrices or term-document matrices. Finally, an exploratory text analysis will be conducted and corresponding marketing implications pointed out. 1.1 Dictionaries for NLP For this exercise I will use 3 different lexicons available for R. One of them is AFINN, a lexicon of words rated for valence between minus five (indicating negative valence) and plus five (indicating positive valence). Next, I will use NRC Emotion Lexicon, which consists of English words and their labels for eight basic emotions (anger, fear, anticipation, trust, surprise, sadness, joy, and disgust) and two sentiments (negative and positive). # Dictionaries ---- afinn &lt;- get_sentiments(&quot;afinn&quot;) bing &lt;- get_sentiments(&quot;bing&quot;) loughran &lt;- get_sentiments(&quot;loughran&quot;) nrc &lt;- get_sentiment_dictionary(&#39;nrc&#39;, language = &quot;english&quot;) 1.2 Data set For our analysis, we will use text of 200 online customer reviews from Apple MacBook Pro (16-inch, 16GB RAM, 512GB Storage, 2.6GHz Intel Core i7) obtained in unpre-processed form: ## [1] &quot;\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n Great product. Replacement for my other macbook that lasted 7 years and was still going strong besides the battery. Great upgrade\\n\\n \\n&quot; ## [2] &quot;\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n Top notch until you don&#39;t use external monitor as well. Its common issue\\n\\n \\n&quot; ## [3] &quot;\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n This is my first Mac and I love it. Apple is the BEST!\\n\\n \\n&quot; ## [4] &quot;\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n Basically, the laptop is a work of art. You know exactly what youre buying with an Apple product. I love that it comes with 16 GB of memory as default. The video card is very powerful. The touchpad is huge and works flawlessly. It is expensive, but worth every penny.\\n\\n \\n&quot; ## [5] &quot;\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n A los dos dias de usarlo la pantalla se puso a rayas\\n\\n \\n \\n&quot; ## [6] &quot;\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n Product too heavy. Returned and have not received refund.\\n\\n \\n&quot; ## [7] &quot;\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n I love this laptop - the screen resolution is beautiful, the light up touch bar is super nice and an innovative touch. I have recently converted form a PC user to MAC after all the years that I have enjoyed other apple products such as Ipad, and I doubt I&#39;d switch back.\\n\\n \\n&quot; ## [8] &quot;\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n It is well made, Liked it had two positions when opened rather than just one. However, it would have been better if it had three reading positions when opened.\\n\\n \\n&quot; ## [9] &quot;\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n Great laptop! I have been using it for months now and havent had any issues. Highly recommended\\n\\n \\n&quot; ## [10] &quot;\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n I opened the box and was like, Hello Lover It&#39;s gorgeous.\\n\\n \\n&quot; 1.3 Corpus cleaning From the results above we could see that text contains unnecessary characters. Therefore, I will use some usual procedure to clean up the reviews text and make it more understandable. For the purpose of this exercise and for efficiency reasons, we will use the volatile corpus, that stores the collection of documents in RAM memory. To create a volatile corpus, I need to pass reviews text in such a form that each review text is interpretated as a document. # Creation of volatile corpus review.corpus &lt;- VCorpus(VectorSource(review$review_text)) We see that the volatile corpus contains as many documents as many online reviews we collected. To undertake a custom transformation, I will use tm package and content_transformer() function. It takes a custom function as input, which defines what transformation needs to be done: review.toSpace&lt;- content_transformer(function (x , pattern ) gsub(pattern, &quot; &quot;, x)) review.corpus &lt;- tm_map(review.corpus, review.toSpace, &quot;/&quot;) # remove &quot;/&quot; review.corpus &lt;- tm_map(review.corpus, review.toSpace, &quot;@&quot;) # remove &quot;@&quot; review.corpus &lt;- tm_map(review.corpus, review.toSpace, &quot;\\\\|&quot;) # remove &quot;\\\\|&quot; review.corpus &lt;- tm_map(review.corpus, content_transformer(tolower)) # convert all capital letters to small review.corpus &lt;- tm_map(review.corpus, removeNumbers) # convert all capital letters to small review.corpus &lt;- tm_map(review.corpus, removeWords, stopwords(&quot;english&quot;)) # remove stop-words review.corpus &lt;- tm_map(review.corpus, removePunctuation) # remove punctuation review.corpus &lt;- tm_map(review.corpus, stripWhitespace) # strip extra whitespace from a document After cleaning the corpus, we can use document-term-matrix to store our cleaned corpus: review.dtm &lt;- DocumentTermMatrix(review.corpus) However, document-term-matrix is not the most suitable to work with, because it stores review texts in rows and terms frequencies in columns. We will transform it with tidy function: # Tidy up the document-term-matrix review.tidy &lt;- tidy(review.dtm) review.tidy$count &lt;-as.numeric(review.tidy$count) # Ensure correct class colnames(review.tidy)[2]&lt;- &#39;word&#39; # change name of the column from &quot;term&quot; to &quot;word&quot; review.tidy$document &lt;- as.numeric(review.tidy$document) # Ensure correct class Our tidy format has dimensions 6907 (the total number of terms) x 3 (document, term and count of the term in corresponding document): dim(review.tidy) # Dimensions ## [1] 6907 3 head(review.tidy)# Display first 6 rows ## # A tibble: 6 x 3 ## document word count ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 1 battery 1 ## 2 1 besides 1 ## 3 1 going 1 ## 4 1 great 2 ## 5 1 lasted 1 ## 6 1 macbook 1 1.4 Visualisations of terms frequency 1.4.1 Bar charts with the most frequent terms We would be interested in the most frequent words used in customer reviews. Sometimes just a glimpse of the most frequent words is sufficient to get some insights. Here we see that word love and great appears among most frequent terms. # Most frequent terms ---- review.tdm &lt;- TermDocumentMatrix(review.corpus) review.m &lt;- as.data.frame.matrix(review.tdm) review.v &lt;- sort(rowSums(review.m),decreasing=TRUE) word.names&lt;-names(review.v) df.review.v&lt;-data.frame(review.v,word.names) colnames(df.review.v)&lt;-c(&quot;n&quot;,&quot;word&quot;) p&lt;-ggplot(data=df.review.v[1:20,], aes(x=reorder(word,n), y=n)) + geom_bar(stat=&quot;identity&quot;,fill=&quot;steelblue&quot;) + coord_flip() + ggtitle(&quot;20 most frequent words in customer reviews - MacBook Pro&quot;)+ xlab(&quot;Count&quot;)+ ylab(&quot;Word&quot;)+ theme_test() ggplotly(p) 1.4.2 Wordcloud with the most frequent terms Similarly to the bar chart with the most frequent words, we could use wordcloud as well. It displays words from the corpus and signalizes their frequency by displaying more frequent words bigger relative to those that appear less frequently in the corpus. In the wordcloud below you can see 200 most frequent words, where the minimum frequency was set to 1. # Wordcloud review.tdm &lt;- TermDocumentMatrix(review.corpus) review.m &lt;- as.matrix(review.tdm) review.v &lt;- sort(rowSums(review.m),decreasing=TRUE) review.d &lt;- data.frame(word = names(review.v),freq=review.v) set.seed(1234) wordcloud(words = review.d$word, freq = review.d$freq, min.freq = 1, max.words=200, random.order=FALSE, rot.per=0.35, colors=brewer.pal(8, &quot;Dark2&quot;)) 1.4.3 The most frequent terms indicating emotions When it comes to anticipation, words such as good,time,happy or powerful indicates that this emotion can be identified among customer reviews. On the other hand, there are some words that could be a signal both for good and bad experience: finally,money or wait. # Anticipation words---- nrc.anticipation &lt;- subset(nrc, nrc$sentiment==&quot;anticipation&quot;) review.anticipation.words &lt;- inner_join(review.tidy, nrc.anticipation) review.anticipation.words &lt;- count(review.anticipation.words, word) review.anticipation.words &lt;- review.anticipation.words[order(review.anticipation.words$n,decreasing = TRUE),] p&lt;-ggplot(data=review.anticipation.words[1:20,], aes(x=reorder(word,n), y=n)) + geom_bar(stat=&quot;identity&quot;,fill=&quot;orange&quot;) + coord_flip() + ggtitle(&quot;20 most frequent anticipation words in customer reviews&quot;)+ xlab(&quot;Count&quot;)+ ylab(&quot;Word&quot;)+ theme_minimal() ggplotly(p) Similarly to anticipation, now we observe a list of top 20 words that indicate trust. It reveals new quite frequent term in the corpus: recommend. # Trust words---- nrc.trust &lt;- subset(nrc, nrc$sentiment==&quot;trust&quot;) review.trust.words &lt;- inner_join(review.tidy, nrc.trust) review.trust.words &lt;- count(review.trust.words, word) review.trust.words &lt;- review.trust.words[order(review.trust.words$n,decreasing = TRUE),] p&lt;-ggplot(data=review.trust.words[1:20,], aes(x=reorder(word,n), y=n)) + geom_bar(stat=&quot;identity&quot;,fill=&quot;royalblue1&quot;) + coord_flip() + ggtitle(&quot;20 most frequent trust words in customer reviews&quot;)+ xlab(&quot;Count&quot;)+ ylab(&quot;Word&quot;)+ theme_minimal() ggplotly(p) Although at the bottom of the list, The top 20 list of joy words displays some additional words that we did not observe previously such as beautiful,gorgeous,wonderful,improvement,excellent. # Joy words ---- nrc.joy &lt;- subset(nrc, nrc$sentiment==&quot;joy&quot;) review.joy.words &lt;- inner_join(review.tidy, nrc.joy) review.joy.words &lt;- count(review.joy.words, word) review.joy.words &lt;- review.joy.words[order(review.joy.words$n,decreasing = TRUE),] p&lt;-ggplot(data=review.joy.words[1:20,], aes(x=reorder(word,n), y=n)) + geom_bar(stat=&quot;identity&quot;,fill=&quot;darkorange1&quot;) + coord_flip() + ggtitle(&quot;20 most frequent trust words in customer reviews&quot;)+ xlab(&quot;Count&quot;)+ ylab(&quot;Word&quot;)+ theme_minimal() ggplotly(p) 1.5 Sentiment analysis 1.5.1 Polarity timeline One usual way to compare and quantify emotions in text is via polarity. We simply count number of unique words in each document (=review) labelled as negative and deduct from the count of unique positive words. For instance, the first review contains 2 unique positive words (great and strong) and none negative unique words. Therefore, its polarity score is 2. This polarity timeline suggests very important implication: the reviews sentiment is moving above the 0, bearly going even below +2, giving an indication that this product continuously meet customers expectations. That is a good signal to believe that customers are rather satisfied with the product. # Polarity timeline ---- review.sentiment &lt;- inner_join(review.tidy, bing) review.sentiment &lt;- count(review.sentiment, sentiment, index=document) review.sentiment &lt;- spread(review.sentiment, sentiment, n, fill=0) review.sentiment$polarity &lt;- review.sentiment$positive - review.sentiment$negative review.sentiment$pos &lt;- ifelse(review.sentiment$polarity &gt;=0, &quot;Positive&quot;, &quot;Negative&quot;) p&lt;-ggplot(review.sentiment, aes(x=index, y=polarity, fill=pos))+geom_bar(stat=&quot;identity&quot;, position=&quot;identity&quot;, width=1)+theme_gdocs()+ggtitle(label=&quot;Polarity timeline&quot;) ggplotly(p) # Smooth curve review.smooth &lt;- ggplot(review.sentiment, aes(index, polarity)) p&lt;-review.smooth + stat_smooth() + theme_gdocs() + ggtitle(&quot;Polarity timeline - smooth&quot;) ggplotly(p) In the polarity graph at index 81 we identify a review with sentiment score of even 34! This seems to be a thrilled customer every brand loves! Let us take closer look: review.sentiment &lt;- inner_join(review.tidy, bing) doc_81&lt;-filter(review.sentiment, document==&quot;81&quot;) head(doc_81[order(doc_81$count,decreasing = T),]) ## # A tibble: 6 x 4 ## document word count sentiment ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 81 best 3 positive ## 2 81 better 3 positive ## 3 81 improved 3 positive ## 4 81 amazing 2 positive ## 5 81 breeze 2 positive ## 6 81 good 2 positive Finally, it certainly pays off to check the actual review: # Outlier in polarity score review$review_text[81] ## [1] &quot;\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n If you&#39;ve been waiting for Apple to wake up and address the concerns raised by the Apple community -- your wait is now over. This is the MacBook Pro we&#39;ve all been wanting for years. This review is for the higher end model, stock.The good.- Keyboard. It&#39;s fantastic. The key travel has been extended to 1mm, which is about half of the original keyboard found on the 2015 and prior model years. It feels just as good to type on because apple improved the tactile feedback. The keys sort of spring back. The keyboard is quiet and very comfortable to type on. The keys are slightly smaller but do not make typing on them any more difficult. The directional arrows are now properly setup and the physical Esc key is back, making it a breeze to flip through open applications.- Screen. The difference in size is subtle but noticeable. It&#39;s technically even more dense, but just barely. You won&#39;t notice much difference from recent MacBook Pros but true to Apple, the display is absolutely gorgeous. The 0.6 inch difference in size retains the same logical resolution, so everything should look just slightly bigger which I welcome.- Processor. The base model has the same chipset as the 2019 15.4\\&quot; model. The performance, however, is about 10% better due to significantly improved airflow and larger heatsinks. The issue of heat related throttling has been largely addressed. On the upper model, the machine now comes with 8 cores and serious performance bump. There is literally nothing you can throw at this MacBook that it won&#39;t handle with breeze.- Graphics. The traditional setup is still here. You have the onboard Intel chipset, which operates when the demand for visual performance is low. You also have a discrete AMD chip which delivers significant improvement over the previous generation. In fact, the base model delivers performance in excess of the upper spec Vega chipset from last year. The leap is extraordinary. As before, the system will automatically choose which graphics card to use depending on demand.- Sound. In one world, amazing. Imagine Apple took a HomePod and flattened it to fit it in the housing of the MacBook Pro. That is essentially the experience. Bass is pronounced and crisp and treble is sharp. The sound is rich and room-filling. There are six speakers instead of two in the last generation.-Microphone. Major improvements with three mics instead of one in the previous generation. I use the MacBook to make calls using an iPhone and the sound on the other end is clear and free from background noice. I&#39;ve been told it sounds a lot better than before, but that is of course subjective. On paper, you&#39;re getting better noise reduction and improved sound fidelity.- Touch Bar. Controversial in the past, I think it may now be the \\&quot;happy medium\\&quot; between physical keys and the useful Touch Bar which adapts to the content on the screen. The Esc key is back and on the right hand side you&#39;ll find Touch ID and power button.- SSD. You&#39;ll love the fact that now base starting size of the SSD has been doubled on both the entry model and the upper model with 512GB and 1TB respectively.- Gaming. This has to be mentioned. The graphics card offers incredible leap in performance. Modern games that would get 14-16FPS on high setting now perform at 35-40FPS with ease. Same settings. Same games. Huge improvement. It&#39;s now possible to play AAA games on the MacBook Pro with reasonable performance and high visual settings.- Productivity. This machine is a beast. I use the full Affinity suite and do some limited video editing. In addition, I have multiple productivity programs open, over a dozen Safari tabs, two email clients, and dozens of other apps, such as CRM, task managers, notes, etc. Everything runs smoothly.- Value. Yes, value. This expensive laptop brings the best value in the lineup of the 15.\\&quot;4 (now 16\\&quot;) offering to date. If you carefully look at the costs of truly compatible Windows offerings, you&#39;ll find the MacBook Pro to be competitively priced.The Bad- Weight. The machine is slightly heavier but I welcome the added bulky. Finally Apple went with functionality over its obsession with thiner and lighter hardware, giving us a machine with proper thermal management, proper keyboard and more. But if you plan on taking it with you places, you&#39;ll feel the extra bulk.- BTO Updates. The cost of BTO options is still quite high, with the noted exception of the 8GB option on the GPU. You&#39;re still paying a significant premium for each incremental upgrade over the base model.To sum up -- This is the best MacBook Pro in many years. It&#39;s a well-rounded, powerful machine that brings about incredible performance and value. I would highly recommend it to any Pro.If you&#39;re upgrading from the 13\\&quot; model and wonder how much more real estate you can expect, see attached side-by-side comparison photo.Update 3/15/20 -- Absolutely a beast of a machine. I love it. It has been pretty much perfect and its performance continues to surprise me. I have the top-speced model and it smokes pretty much everything I&#39;ve used to date. In fact, it will perform on par with the new Mac Pro base configuration. Don&#39;t believe me? Google it. This is by far the best MacBook Pro to date and an amazing value. Well worth the price of admission if you need it.\\n\\n \\n&quot; It seems that our assumption was correct! The customer was definitely thrilled! This is a nice example how you can identify and take closer look at reviews that stand out based on its polarity score. 1.5.2 Analysis on sentence-level Text analysis provides freedom to choose level of observation. So far, we explored words and their frequencies, we explored customer reviews and quantified their sentiment in two dimensions (positive and negative). Next, we will approach the task of identifying the most negative and positive reviews by organizing text by sentences. By doing so, we will directly access those sentences whose average sentiment stand out. # Calculating the average sentiment review.highlighted&lt;-review$review_text%&gt;% get_sentences() %&gt;% sentiment_by() head(review.highlighted) ## element_id word_count sd ave_sentiment ## 1: 1 2 NA 0.35355339 ## 2: 2 16 NA 0.12500000 ## 3: 3 2 NA 0.35355339 ## 4: 4 10 NA 0.06324555 ## 5: 5 3 NA -0.57735027 ## 6: 6 9 NA 0.25000000 # Preparing data review.score &lt;- subset(review.highlighted, select = c(&quot;ave_sentiment&quot;,&quot;element_id&quot;)) review.worst &lt;- review.score[order(review.score$ave_sentiment,decreasing = FALSE),] review.worst&lt;-review.worst$element_id[1:10] review.best &lt;- review.score[order(review.score$ave_sentiment, decreasing = TRUE),] review.best &lt;- review.best$element_id[1:10] sentences&lt;-review$review_text %&gt;% get_sentences() sentences&lt;-as.matrix(sentences) And here we have the worst 10 sentences from customer reviews; # 10 worst sentences sentences[review.worst] ## [1] &quot;The screen is nice but has ridiculous ghosting.&quot; ## [2] &quot;Very disappointed.&quot; ## [3] &quot;Force cancelling woofers keep the annoying vibration at louder playback at bay.&quot; ## [4] &quot;I am very disappointed!&quot; ## [5] &quot;Having ports would have been nice (especially seeing how much space would be available for ports) but unfortunately, that is how Apple operates.&quot; ## [6] &quot;This is a Finder issue, as apps launch but don&#39;t leap to the top.&quot; ## [7] &quot;Im glad I didnt have important files to transfer or I would have been upset.&quot; ## [8] &quot;I guess I got a lemon, which is disappointing considering the high cost.&quot; ## [9] &quot;Small issue: fan comes up too often ( I do application development with it).&quot; ## [10] &quot;Very suspicious batch.&quot; Despite the fact that positive sentiment prevails, we see that there are certain problems associated with MacBook laptop. Issues with screen, problems with woofers, disappointment that there are no ports, unsatisfying value-price ratio. # 10 most positive sentences sentences[review.best] ## [1] &quot;Yes its considerably big and heavy compared to others, but Honestly that just feels like better quality to me&quot; ## [2] &quot;Quality is very good.&quot; ## [3] &quot;Extremely pleased with my NEW MacBook Pro!&quot; ## [4] &quot;This MacBook Pro 16\\&quot; is outstanding and much much better than the previous generation.&quot; ## [5] &quot;Overall, this new MacBook is rather pricey, but there&#39;s a reason it is called \\&quot;Pro\\&quot; because it is designed for professional.&quot; ## [6] &quot;Very fast!&quot; ## [7] &quot;Very fast, great screen, fantastic keyboard and wonderful speakers.&quot; ## [8] &quot;If you&#39;re upgrading from the 13\\&quot; model and wonder how much more real estate you can expect, see attached side-by-side comparison photo.&quot; ## [9] &quot;Well made computerBest specsNo much innovation from the 15 MacBook Pro that I Have.&quot; ## [10] &quot;I absolutely love this new Mac!&quot; If we take a look at 10 most positive sentences from customer reviews, we would find a similar evidence as we obtained with polarity score. However, by reading those sentences a reader can have better feeling what the reviewer is actually satisfied or unsatisfied with. Here we see that some people admire the speed for instance. 1.5.3 What are the most emotional reviews? Package sentimentr provides nice function emotion() which uses a dictionary to find emotion words and then compute the rate per sentence. The final emotion score ranges between 0 (no emotion used) and 1 (all words used were emotional). # Extract emotions terms reviews.emotion &lt;- review$review_text %&gt;% get_sentences() %&gt;% emotion() # Top 50 sentences with the highest emotion score top_emotional_sentences &lt;- unique(reviews.emotion[order(reviews.emotion$emotion,decreasing = TRUE),]$element_id[1:50]) # The most emotional reviews sentences[top_emotional_sentences,] ## [1] &quot;Frustrated!&quot; &quot;PERFECT!!!!&quot; &quot;Finally!&quot; ## [4] &quot;Hot damn.&quot; &quot;Hot.&quot; &quot;Damn.&quot; ## [7] &quot;LOVE LOVE LOVE it!&quot; &quot;The Bad- Weight.&quot; &quot;Highly recommend.&quot; ## [10] &quot;Highly recommend.&quot; &quot;Outstanding laptop.&quot; &quot;Excellent computer&quot; ## [13] &quot;Loving it!&quot; &quot;Good computer.&quot; &quot;good product&quot; ## [16] &quot;Huge improvement.&quot; &quot;So disappointed.....&quot; &quot;Very disappointed.&quot; ## [19] &quot;so disappointed.&quot; &quot;Good keyboard.&quot; &quot;Ridiculously good.&quot; We can see that identified sentences very clearly reflect emotions that customers expressed. It seems that intensity of emotions is high in both positive and negative direction. Finally, we can plot detected emotions in order to get a bit more clear insight in emotional structure detected in the reviews: # Plot of emotion p&lt;-plot(reviews.emotion, transformation.function = syuzhet::get_dct_transform, drop.unused.emotions = TRUE, facet = TRUE) ggplotly(p) This plot depicts emotional inclination of the reviews. Curves indicating emotional propensity of trust, joy and anticipation suggest strong inclination towards mentioned emotions. In line with the academic paper The Role of Emotions for the Perceived Usefulness in Online Customer Reviews, we have found an evidence that online reviews analyzed encode emotions contributing to the higher helpfulness rating, i.e. quality of reviews. In the end, it is important to mention that the role and influence of emotions defined by Plutchik on the quality of reviews differ across different product categories.

Figure 2.1: Foto von Andrea Piacquadio von Pexels At the beginning of 2020 I heared that my working colleagues from another institute at the WU have launched an initiative called CO2mustGO initiative. The initiative aims to gather multinational group of students, researchers and teachers from the Vienna University of Economics and Business and other universities around Europe, to unite around the single issue of carbon price. This project started as a university course, with the vision of uniting students and scientists in an international movement supporting every serious carbon price initiative globally. Since my hometown, Tuzla, heavily suffers from the air pollution, I felt that I should give my contribution to this initiative and joined them in April 2020. I decided to support it with my R programming skills. Consequently, I ended up analyzing Twitter data, as it is one of the hot-spots for this topic. My role was to spark interest of stakeholders regarding this issue by using data available. Therefore, my tasks were related to using R to create understandable visualizations and to make use of Twitter data available. 2.1 Sankey diagram: Energy production capacity # Creation of source table$typ_11 &lt;- factor(table$typ_11,levels = c(&quot;c1&quot;,&quot;c2&quot;,&quot;g1&quot;,&quot;g2&quot;,&quot;g3&quot;,&quot;g4&quot;,&quot;n&quot;,&quot;o1&quot;,&quot;o2&quot;,&quot;o3&quot;,&quot;o4&quot;,&quot;r1&quot;,&quot;res&quot;),labels = c(&quot;0&quot;,&quot;1&quot;,&quot;2&quot;,&quot;3&quot;,&quot;4&quot;,&quot;5&quot;,&quot;6&quot;,&quot;7&quot;,&quot;8&quot;,&quot;9&quot;,&quot;10&quot;,&quot;11&quot;,&quot;12&quot;)) source1 &lt;- as.vector.factor(table$typ_11) source1 &lt;- as.numeric(source1) #Country as mediator table2 &lt;- table table2$country&lt;-as.character(table2$country) table2$country[table$country==&quot;AT&quot;] &lt;- 14 table2$country[table$country==&quot;BE&quot;] &lt;- 15 table2$country[table$country==&quot;BG&quot;] &lt;- 16 table2$country[table$country==&quot;CH&quot;] &lt;- 17 table2$country[table$country==&quot;CY&quot;] &lt;- 18 table2$country[table$country==&quot;CZ&quot;] &lt;- 19 table2$country[table$country==&quot;DE&quot;] &lt;- 20 table2$country[table$country==&quot;DK&quot;] &lt;- 21 table2$country[table$country==&quot;EE&quot;] &lt;- 22 table2$country[table$country==&quot;ES&quot;] &lt;- 23 table2$country[table$country==&quot;FI&quot;] &lt;- 24 table2$country[table$country==&quot;FR&quot;] &lt;- 25 table2$country[table$country==&quot;GR&quot;] &lt;- 26 table2$country[table$country==&quot;HR&quot;] &lt;- 27 table2$country[table$country==&quot;HU&quot;] &lt;- 28 table2$country[table$country==&quot;IE&quot;] &lt;- 29 table2$country[table$country==&quot;IT&quot;] &lt;- 30 table2$country[table$country==&quot;LT&quot;] &lt;- 31 table2$country[table$country==&quot;LU&quot;] &lt;- 32 table2$country[table$country==&quot;LV&quot;] &lt;- 33 table2$country[table$country==&quot;NL&quot;] &lt;- 34 table2$country[table$country==&quot;NO&quot;] &lt;- 35 table2$country[table$country==&quot;PL&quot;] &lt;- 36 table2$country[table$country==&quot;PT&quot;] &lt;- 37 table2$country[table$country==&quot;RO&quot;] &lt;- 38 table2$country[table$country==&quot;SE&quot;] &lt;- 39 table2$country[table$country==&quot;SI&quot;] &lt;- 40 table2$country[table$country==&quot;SK&quot;] &lt;- 41 table2$country[table$country==&quot;UK&quot;] &lt;- 42 target1&lt;- table2$country #Creation of mediator(country),source and value value &lt;- table2 %&gt;% group_by(country,typ_11) %&gt;% count(mw_2018) #1st part of Target target1 &lt;- value$country target1&lt;-as.numeric(target1) #1st part of Value value1&lt;-value$mw_2018 #Creation of the final target value.df &lt;-table2 %&gt;% group_by(country)%&gt;% summarise(sum(mw_2018)) value.df$country&lt;-as.numeric(value.df$country) #2nd part of Source(from countries to total capacity) target1.2 &lt;-value.df$country #2nd part of Values (total of countries to the grand total) value1.2&lt;-value.df$`sum(mw_2018)` #Final target ft&lt;-rep(13,29) final_target &lt;- c(target1,ft) #final source final_soruce &lt;-c(source1,target1.2) #final value final_value &lt;-c(value1,value1.2) fig &lt;- plot_ly( type = &quot;sankey&quot;, orientation = &quot;h&quot;, valuesuffix = &quot;MW&quot;, arrangement = &quot;snap&quot;, node = list( label = c( &quot;Coal-lignite&quot;, # Node 0 &quot;Coal-hard&quot;, # Node 1 &quot;G1-gas&quot;, # Node 2 &quot;G2-gas&quot;, # Node 3 &quot;G3-gas&quot;, # Node 4 &quot;G4-gas&quot;, # Node 5 &quot;Nunclear&quot;, # Node 6 &quot;O1-oil&quot;, # Node 7 &quot;O2-oil&quot;, # Node 8 &quot;O3-oil&quot;, # Node 9 &quot;O4-oil&quot;, # Node 10 &quot;Renewables&quot;,# Node 11 &quot;Hydro&quot;, # Node 12 &quot;Total capacity&quot;, # Node 13 &quot;AT&quot;,#Node 14 &quot;BE&quot;,#Node 15 &quot;BG&quot;,#Node 16 &quot;CH&quot;,#Node 17 &quot;CY&quot;,#Node 18 &quot;CZ&quot;,#Node 19 &quot;DE&quot;,#Node 20 &quot;DK&quot;,#Node 21 &quot;EE&quot;,#Node 22 &quot;ES&quot;,#Node 23 &quot;FI&quot;,#Node 24 &quot;FR&quot;,#Node 25 &quot;GR&quot;,#Node 26 &quot;HR&quot;,#Node 27 &quot;HU&quot;,#Node 28 &quot;IE&quot;,#Node 29 &quot;IT&quot;,#Node 30 &quot;LT&quot;,#Node 31 &quot;LU&quot;,#Node 32 &quot;LV&quot;,#Node 33 &quot;NL&quot;,#Node 34 &quot;NO&quot;,#Node 35 &quot;PL&quot;,#Node 36 &quot;PT&quot;,#Node 37 &quot;RO&quot;,#Node 38 &quot;SE&quot;,#Node 39 &quot;SI&quot;,#Node 40 &quot;SK&quot;,#Node 41 &quot;UK&quot;)),#Node 42 link = list( source = final_soruce, target = final_target, value = final_value)) total.capacity &lt;- fig %&gt;% layout(title = &quot;Energy Production Capacity in the EU&quot;) total.capacity Figure 2.2: Energy production capacities in the EU In order to depict the nature of energy production facilities across EU countries, I created this sankey diagram. On the left side, you can see types of energy sources across the EU countries (data is not updated). In the middle, you can see respective countries. Finally, on the right you see the total of energy production. Especially nice feature of the visualization is the interactive component, so that, for instance, using Box select option, you can merge certain number of components of the same type (e.g., select 3 sources of energy) and the visualization changes accordingly. Twitter data analysis Twitter is nowadays among platforms that host strong communities. Carbon footprint and its repercussions belongs to prominent climate issue. Consequently, I decided to analyze Tweets downloaded via Twitter API on on 10.06.2020. The aim was simply to explore data about tweets with hashtags #carbonfootprint or #co2 and try to draw conclusions on how to approach social media presence on Twitter. 2.1.1 Data Our data was stored in CSV format.rtweet package provides nice function to read in data conveniently. #library(rtweet) # Read in Tweets data carbon_tweets &lt;- read_twitter_csv(&quot;data/#carbonfootprintOR#greenhouse-tweets.csv&quot;, unflatten = T) # Delete empty columns carbon_tweets &lt;- carbon_tweets[, colSums(is.na(carbon_tweets)) != nrow(carbon_tweets)] # Head of the data set dim(carbon_tweets) ## [1] 1858 86 Our data set contains 1858 Tweets and 86 features. 2.2 Text cleaning and preprocessing Tweets text in our data set requires some preprocessing and cleaning as it contains elements that are not helpful for our analysis. # Text cleaning carbon_tweets$stripped_text &lt;- gsub(&quot;https\\\\S*&quot;,&quot;&quot;, carbon_tweets$text) carbon_tweets$stripped_text &lt;- gsub(&quot;@\\\\S*&quot;,&quot;&quot;, carbon_tweets$stripped_text) carbon_tweets$stripped_text &lt;- gsub(&quot;amp&quot;,&quot;&quot;,carbon_tweets$stripped_text) carbon_tweets$stripped_text &lt;- gsub(&quot;[\\r\\n]&quot;,&quot;&quot;,carbon_tweets$stripped_text) carbon_tweets$stripped_text &lt;- gsub(&quot;[[:punct:]]&quot;, &quot;&quot;,carbon_tweets$stripped_text) # Text to lowercase, punctuation removed, frequency of the each word added carbon_tweets_clean &lt;- carbon_tweets %&gt;% dplyr::select(stripped_text) %&gt;% unnest_tokens(word, stripped_text) # Remove stop words data(&quot;stop_words&quot;) carbon_tweets_words &lt;- carbon_tweets_clean %&gt;% anti_join(stop_words) 2.3 Tweets distribution Since our data set contains information about the time Tweets are posted, I was interested to see the distribution of Tweets in the given period. # Distribution of tweets considered in the data. search_term &lt;- &#39;#carbonfootprint OR #co2&#39; by &lt;- &#39;hour&#39; p &lt;- ts_plot(carbon_tweets, by = by, trim = 2) + geom_point(col = &quot;#00acee&quot;) + theme_minimal() + labs(title = paste0(&quot;Tweets with &quot;,search_term,&quot; by &quot;,by),x = &#39;Date&#39;, y = &#39;Count&#39;) ggplotly(p) The period captured in our data set is from 15:00 on 2nd of June to 11:00 A.M. on 10th of June. Interestingly enough, there was certain occasion on 6th of June important for our topic. We see from the number of Tweets with hashtags #carbonfootprint or #co2, which stood at 43! This happening has to be more closely analyzed. 2.4 Word Frequency in Tweets Next, I wanted to inspect the word frequency in the Tweets from the data set. p &lt;- carbon_tweets_words %&gt;% dplyr::count(word, sort=T) %&gt;% top_n(10) %&gt;% mutate(word = reorder(word, n)) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = word, y = n)) + geom_col(fill=&quot;deepskyblue&quot;) + theme_minimal()+ xlab(NULL) + coord_flip() + labs(x = &quot;Count&quot;, y = &quot;Unique words&quot;, title = &quot;Count of unique words found in tweets&quot;) ggplotly(p) Generally, no major surprises regarding the most frequent words. It can be noted that term worldenvironmentday appears frequently as the World Environment Day is on 5th of June. 2.5 Word Network in Tweets Knowing that Tweets are short messages, I decided to inspect word network in order to possibly observe some unusual word combinations. The word network is made based on bi-grams. Basically, based on the number of times two words shows up together. # Remove punctuation, convert to lowercase, add id for each tweet! carbon_tweets_paired_words &lt;- carbon_tweets %&gt;% dplyr::select(stripped_text) %&gt;% unnest_tokens(paired_words, stripped_text, token = &quot;ngrams&quot;, n = 2) #library(tidyr) carbon_tweets_separated_words &lt;- carbon_tweets_paired_words %&gt;% separate(paired_words, c(&quot;word1&quot;, &quot;word2&quot;), sep = &quot; &quot;) carbon_tweets_filtered &lt;- carbon_tweets_separated_words %&gt;% filter(!word1 %in% stop_words$word) %&gt;% filter(!word2 %in% stop_words$word) carbon_words_counts &lt;- carbon_tweets_filtered %&gt;% dplyr::count(word1, word2, sort = TRUE) #library(igraph) #library(ggraph) # Plot carbon change word network p&lt;- carbon_words_counts %&gt;% filter(n &gt;=30) %&gt;% graph_from_data_frame() %&gt;% ggraph(layout = &quot;fr&quot;) + geom_edge_link(aes(edge_alpha = 0.5, edge_width = n)) + geom_node_point(color = &quot;darkslategray4&quot;, size = 3) + geom_node_text(aes(label = name), vjust = 1.8, size = 3) + labs(title = &quot;Word Network: Tweets using the hashtag #carbonfootprint or #co2&quot;, subtitle = &quot;Text mining twitter data &quot;, x = &quot;&quot;, y = &quot;&quot;) p An interesting observation is that the word network shows the word justiceforvinayaki appering together with climatecrisis. More specifically, justiceforvinayaki is actually a hashtag related to the story behind the pregnant elephants killing in Keralas Palakkad. More you can read here. 2.6 Wordcloud In order to get a bigger picture of frequent terms in Tweets, I created a wordcloud. # Text preparation carbon_tweets$stripped_text &lt;- iconv(carbon_tweets$stripped_text, &#39;utf-8&#39;, &#39;ascii&#39;, sub=&#39;&#39;) review.docs &lt;- Corpus(VectorSource(carbon_tweets$stripped_text)) review.toSpace&lt;- content_transformer(function (x , pattern ) gsub(pattern, &quot; &quot;, x)) review.docs &lt;- tm_map(review.docs, review.toSpace, &quot;/&quot;) review.docs &lt;- tm_map(review.docs, review.toSpace, &quot;@&quot;) review.docs &lt;- tm_map(review.docs, review.toSpace, &quot;\\\\|&quot;) review.docs &lt;- tm_map(review.docs, content_transformer(tolower)) review.docs &lt;- tm_map(review.docs, removeNumbers) review.docs &lt;- tm_map(review.docs, removeWords, stopwords(&quot;english&quot;)) my_list &lt;- c(&quot;carbonfootprint&quot;,&quot;greenhouse&quot;,&quot;can&quot;,&quot;will&quot;,&quot;wont&quot;) review.docs &lt;- tm_map(review.docs, removeWords,my_list) review.docs &lt;- tm_map(review.docs, content_transformer(tolower)) review.docs &lt;- tm_map(review.docs, removePunctuation) review.docs &lt;- tm_map(review.docs, stripWhitespace) review.tdm &lt;- TermDocumentMatrix(review.docs) review.m &lt;- as.matrix(review.tdm) review.v &lt;- sort(rowSums(review.m),decreasing=TRUE) review.d &lt;- data.frame(word = names(review.v),freq=review.v) set.seed(1234) wordcloud(words = review.d$word, freq = review.d$freq, max.words = 200, min.freq = 10, random.order=FALSE, rot.per=0.15, colors=brewer.pal(8, &quot;Dark2&quot;), scale=c(8,.3), vfont=c(&quot;sans serif&quot;,&quot;plain&quot;)) Minimum word frequency is set to 10, and the wordcloud depicts 200 most frequent terms. As you probably already know, Twitter is a place where discussions are going on frequently. Therefore, it made sense to try to reorganize the wordcloud to indicate positive vs negative terms. library(wordcloud) library(reshape2) par(mar = rep(0, 4)) set.seed(1234) p&lt;-carbon_tweets_words%&gt;% inner_join(get_sentiments(&quot;bing&quot;)) %&gt;% count(word, sentiment,sort = TRUE) %&gt;% acast(word ~ sentiment, value.var = &quot;n&quot;, fill = 0) %&gt;% comparison.cloud(colors = c(&quot;darkred&quot;,&quot;darkgreen&quot;), max.words = 400, min.freq= 10, scale = c(4.0,0.25)) p 2.7 Word associations With the function findAssocs() we are able to inspect correlation between given term and every other word in our term-document-matrix. Strong associations are indicated with numbers closer to 1, while weaker associations are closer to 0. In addition, the function enables setting a cut-off threshold, so that, for instance, it extracts just correlations higher or equal than 0.6. library(cowplot) library(ggplot2) library(ggthemes) tdm &lt;- TermDocumentMatrix(review.docs, control=list(weighting=weightTf)) # Association with the term &quot;globalwarming&quot; associations &lt;- findAssocs(tdm,terms=&quot;globalwarming&quot;, corlimit=0.6) associations &lt;- as.data.frame(associations) associations$terms &lt;- row.names(associations) associations$terms &lt;- factor(associations$terms, levels=associations$terms) assoc_globalwarming &lt;- ggplot(associations, aes(y=terms)) + geom_point (aes(x=globalwarming), data=associations, size=0.01)+ theme_gdocs()+ geom_text(aes(x=globalwarming, label=globalwarming), colour=&quot;red&quot;, hjust=-.5, size=3)+ labs(title = &quot;Terms correlated with the term &#39;globalwarming&#39; (corr &gt; 0.6)&quot;)+ theme(text=element_text(size=8), axis.title.y=element_blank()) ggplotly(assoc_globalwarming) # Association with the term &quot;lose&quot; associations &lt;- findAssocs(tdm,terms=&quot;lose&quot;, corlimit=0.6) associations &lt;- as.data.frame(associations) associations$terms &lt;- row.names(associations) associations$terms &lt;- factor(associations$terms, levels=associations$terms) assoc_lose &lt;- ggplot(associations, aes(y=terms)) + geom_point (aes(x=lose), data=associations, size=0.01)+ theme_gdocs()+ geom_text(aes(x=lose, label=lose), colour=&quot;red&quot;, hjust=-.5, size=3)+ labs(title = &quot;Terms correlated with the term &#39;lose&#39; (corr &gt; 0.6)&quot;)+ theme(text=element_text(size=8), axis.title.y=element_blank()) ggplotly(assoc_lose) 2.8 LDA We could try to break collection of tweets into several topics, so that we can independently understand what topics tweets are associated with. Topic modeling is a tool for unsupervised classification of certain documents that finds natural groups of topics even though we are not sure what we are searching for. # Libraries library(sjmisc) library(topicmodels) library(ldatuning) # Document Term Matrix review.dtm &lt;- DocumentTermMatrix(review.docs) burnin = 1000 iter = 10000 keep = 50 set.seed(510) raw.sum=apply(review.dtm,1,FUN=sum) #sum by raw each raw of the table review.dtm = review.dtm[raw.sum!=0,] lda_basic.model&lt;- LDA(review.dtm, k = 4L, method = &quot;Gibbs&quot;, control = list(burnin = burnin, iter = iter, keep = keep, alpha = 0.01)) lda.terms &lt;- as.matrix(terms(lda_basic.model, 10)) lda.terms&lt;- iconv(lda.terms, &#39;utf-8&#39;, &#39;ascii&#39;, sub=&#39;&#39;) top10termsPerTopic &lt;- terms(lda_basic.model, 10) top10termsPerTopic &lt;- iconv(lda.terms, &#39;utf-8&#39;, &#39;ascii&#39;, sub=&#39;&#39;) colnames(top10termsPerTopic)&lt;-c(&quot;Renewable sources of energy&quot;,&quot;Carbonfootprint emissions&quot;,&quot;Carbonfootprint by businesses&quot;,&quot;Global warming&quot;) top10termsPerTopic ## Renewable sources of energy Carbonfootprint emissions ## [1,] &quot;energy&quot; &quot;carbon&quot; ## [2,] &quot;source&quot; &quot;reduce&quot; ## [3,] &quot;gardening&quot; &quot;worldenvironmentday&quot; ## [4,] &quot;garden&quot; &quot;sustainability&quot; ## [5,] &quot;sustainable&quot; &quot;footprint&quot; ## [6,] &quot;doesnt&quot; &quot;climatechange&quot; ## [7,] &quot;reduce&quot; &quot;emissions&quot; ## [8,] &quot;electricity&quot; &quot;growing&quot; ## [9,] &quot;solarenergy&quot; &quot;gardening&quot; ## [10,] &quot;renewable&quot; &quot;help&quot; ## Carbonfootprint by businesses Global warming ## [1,] &quot;carbon&quot; &quot;environment&quot; ## [2,] &quot;business&quot; &quot;worldenvironmentday&quot; ## [3,] &quot;reduce&quot; &quot;climatechange&quot; ## [4,] &quot;emissions&quot; &quot;world&quot; ## [5,] &quot;energy&quot; &quot;globalwarming&quot; ## [6,] &quot;buy&quot; &quot;just&quot; ## [7,] &quot;best&quot; &quot;climatecrisis&quot; ## [8,] &quot;see&quot; &quot;happy&quot; ## [9,] &quot;footprint&quot; &quot;hope&quot; ## [10,] &quot;sustainability&quot; &quot;climatechangeisreal&quot; We could identify 4 topics such as: Renewable resources Carbonfootprint emissions Carbonfootprint by and sustainability in business Climate and environment crisis caused by global warming 2.9 Sentiment analysis Knowing the nature of the carbon footprint relatFed topics and based on the previous assumption about vivid discussions on Twitter, an analysis of emotions in Tweets would help us in opinion mining. # Sentiment analysis sentiment &lt;- carbon_tweets[,3:5] %&gt;% unnest_tokens(output = &#39;word&#39;, input = &#39;text&#39;) #Add sentiment dataset sentiment_dataset &lt;- get_sentiments(&quot;afinn&quot;) sentiment_dataset &lt;- arrange(sentiment_dataset, -value) #Merge sentiment &lt;- merge(sentiment, sentiment_dataset, by = &#39;word&#39;) #Clean sentiment$word &lt;- NULL sentiment$screen_name &lt;- NULL #Time sentiment$hour &lt;- format(base::round.POSIXt(sentiment$created_at, units=&quot;hours&quot;), format=&quot;%H:%M&quot;) #Pivot pivot &lt;- sentiment %&gt;% group_by(hour) %&gt;% summarise(sentiment = mean(value)) #Plot p &lt;- ggplot(pivot[-1,], aes(x = hour, y = sentiment)) + geom_line(group = 1, color=&quot;deepskyblue&quot;) + geom_point() + theme_minimal() + labs(title = paste0(&#39;Average sentiment of tweetings mentioning &quot;&#39;,search_term,&#39;&quot;&#39;),x = &#39;Date&#39;, y = &#39;Sentiment&#39;, caption = &#39;Source: Twitter API&#39;) ggplotly(p) The visualisation above depicts the average sentiment score of Tweets during a day. It seems that at 10:00 and 15:00 Tweets tend to be less positive than at 17:00 for instance. This information helps for scheduling Tweets so that they dont get caught in the bad moment. 2.10 Visualize the emotions In order to decide what sort of discussion was going on the period of observation, we can visualise the count of words indicating emotions. # Get sentiments using the four different lexicons syuzhet &lt;- get_sentiment(carbon_tweets$stripped_text, method=&quot;syuzhet&quot;) bing &lt;- get_sentiment(carbon_tweets$stripped_text, method=&quot;bing&quot;) afinn &lt;- get_sentiment(carbon_tweets$stripped_text, method=&quot;afinn&quot;) nrc &lt;- get_sentiment(carbon_tweets$stripped_text, method=&quot;nrc&quot;) sentiments &lt;- data.frame(syuzhet, bing, afinn, nrc) # get the emotions using the NRC dictionary nrc.sentiment &lt;- get_nrc_sentiment(carbon_tweets$stripped_text) emo_bar = colSums(nrc.sentiment) emo_sum = data.frame(count=emo_bar, emotion=names(emo_bar)) emo_sum$emotion = factor(emo_sum$emotion, levels=emo_sum$emotion[order(emo_sum$count, decreasing = TRUE)]) # Visualize the emotions from NRC sentiments plot_ly(emo_sum, x=~emotion, y=~count, type=&quot;bar&quot;, color=~emotion) %&gt;% layout(xaxis=list(title=&quot;&quot;), showlegend=FALSE, title=&quot;Distribution of emotion categories&quot;) It seems that positivity, trust, anticipation and joy are far more present in Tweets than emotions usually associated with something negative. Again, we can organize wordcloud so that it does not show just positive or negative words, but rather words associated with corresponding emotion. # Comparison word cloud all = c( paste(carbon_tweets$stripped_text[nrc.sentiment$anger &gt; 0], collapse=&quot; &quot;), paste(carbon_tweets$stripped_text[nrc.sentiment$anticipation &gt; 0], collapse=&quot; &quot;), paste(carbon_tweets$stripped_text[nrc.sentiment$disgust &gt; 0], collapse=&quot; &quot;), paste(carbon_tweets$stripped_text[nrc.sentiment$fear &gt; 0], collapse=&quot; &quot;), paste(carbon_tweets$stripped_text[nrc.sentiment$joy &gt; 0], collapse=&quot; &quot;), paste(carbon_tweets$stripped_text[nrc.sentiment$sadness &gt; 0], collapse=&quot; &quot;), paste(carbon_tweets$stripped_text[nrc.sentiment$surprise &gt; 0], collapse=&quot; &quot;), paste(carbon_tweets$stripped_text[nrc.sentiment$trust &gt; 0], collapse=&quot; &quot;) ) all &lt;- removeWords(all, stopwords(&quot;english&quot;)) # create corpus corpus = Corpus(VectorSource(all)) # # create term-document matrix tdm = TermDocumentMatrix(corpus) # # convert as matrix tdm = as.matrix(tdm) tdm1 &lt;- tdm[nchar(rownames(tdm)) &lt; 11,] # # add column names colnames(tdm) = c(&#39;anger&#39;, &#39;anticipation&#39;, &#39;disgust&#39;, &#39;fear&#39;, &#39;joy&#39;, &#39;sadness&#39;, &#39;surprise&#39;, &#39;trust&#39;) colnames(tdm1) &lt;- colnames(tdm) comparison.cloud(tdm1, random.order=FALSE, colors = c(&quot;#00B2FF&quot;, &quot;red&quot;, &quot;#FF0099&quot;, &quot;#6600CC&quot;, &quot;green&quot;, &quot;orange&quot;, &quot;blue&quot;, &quot;brown&quot;), title.size=1, max.words=250, scale=c(2.5, 0.4),rot.per=0.4) 2.11 Top retweeted Tweets Top retweets (with equal or more than 60 mentions) Next task was to identify Tweets that stand out. The graph below helped me to identify days on which certain Tweets were re-tweeted substaintially more than usually. # Select top retweeted tweets selected &lt;- which(carbon_tweets$retweet_count &gt;= 60) # Plot dates &lt;-as.POSIXct(strptime(carbon_tweets$created_at, format=&quot;%Y-%m-%d&quot;)) plot(x=dates, y=carbon_tweets$retweet_count, type=&quot;l&quot;, col=&quot;grey&quot;, xlab=&quot;Date&quot;, ylab=&quot;Times retweeted&quot;) colors &lt;- rainbow(10)[1:length(selected)] points(dates[selected], carbon_tweets$retweet_count[selected], pch=19, col=colors) Interactive graph with retweets text In this interactive graph I manage to identify Tweets with their text that were re-tweeted frequently. If you hover over big sky-blue points you will see the actual text of each Tweet. # Plotly carbon_tweets$created_at &lt;-as.POSIXct(strptime(carbon_tweets$created_at, format=&quot;%Y-%m-%d&quot;)) p&lt;-ggplot(carbon_tweets, aes(x=created_at, y=retweet_count, col=retweet_count, size=retweet_count, retweet_text=retweet_text, created_at=created_at, retweet_name=retweet_name))+geom_point() +xlab(label=&quot;Date&quot;)+ylab(label=&quot;Retweet count&quot;)+ggtitle(label=&quot;Top retweeted tweets&quot;) ggplotly(p,tooltip = c(&quot;retweet_text&quot;,&quot;retweet_name&quot;)) The most re-tweeted Tweet comes from Forest Products Resolute, which is a global leader in the forest products industry with a diverse range of products, including market pulp, tissue, wood products and papers, which are marketed in close to 70 countries. They tweeted that they are going to take decisive actions towards lowering carbon footprint. 2.12 Network of retweets Finally, I decided to explore the network of the Tweets in order to identify some communities on Twitter that the initiative could potentially join. # Create data frame for the network rt_df &lt;- carbon_tweets[, c(&quot;screen_name&quot; , &quot;retweet_screen_name&quot; )] # Remove rows with missing values rt_df_new &lt;- rt_df[complete.cases(rt_df), ] # Convert to matrix matrx &lt;- as.matrix(rt_df_new) # Create the retweet network nw_rtweet &lt;- graph_from_edgelist(el = matrx, directed = TRUE) # View the retweet network print.igraph(nw_rtweet) ## IGRAPH 651f03c DN-- 1100 936 -- ## + attr: name (v/c) ## + edges from 651f03c (vertex names): ## [1] Amrapali_c -&gt;cathrinejahnsen hanopcan -&gt;GreenTech_SWest ## [3] MehmetO33440789-&gt;UKHaulier m_carmody -&gt;crowdfarmingco ## [5] amrendrakumar02-&gt;SUPERGASind abhishekk85 -&gt;theswitchfix ## [7] MarkCNorwich -&gt;52WeeksForEarth RPiUptime -&gt;TrafficlyApp ## [9] RPiUptime -&gt;TrafficlyApp RPiUptime -&gt;TrafficlyApp ## [11] RPiUptime -&gt;TrafficlyApp RPiUptime -&gt;TrafficlyApp ## [13] RPiUptime -&gt;TrafficlyApp RPiUptime -&gt;TrafficlyApp ## [15] RPiUptime -&gt;TrafficlyApp madebyhyphae -&gt;GreenTech_SWest ## + ... omitted several edges ## [1] 828 2 2.12.1 Where do people tweet the most?

According to the sentiment analysis, Awakening novel is slightly from the beginning to the end. On the other hand, Aspern has a slight drop in the negative sentiment, but the end is positive. Awakening is as twice as longer text than Aspern.

Consumer churn prediction models are developed to determine which consumers are likely to churn and to encourage an effective segmentation of the customer base to enable companies to approach customers at risk of leaving with a retention strategy. Such a prediction models help small marketing budgets to be wisely utilized to minimize turnover, i.e. to maximize the return on marketing expenditure (ROMI). Customer retention has usually been found to be extremely profitable for companies because it costs five to six times more to acquire new customer than to retain an existing customer. Additionally, long-term customers are more profitable, appear to be less susceptible to aggressive marketing activities, appear to be less costly to service, and can create new referrals by positive word-of - mouth. Consequently, even a small improvement in customer retention may yield significant returns. Note: for references take a look at the Reference section options(stringsAsFactor=TRUE) library(curl) library(readr) library(tidyr) library(dplyr) library(randomForest) library(caret) 5.2 Data The data set includes information about: Customers who left within the last month  the column is called Churn. Services that each customer has signed up for  phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies.

Next, we need to prepare our data set in terms of data types. In order to use Random Forest for churn prediction, we need to make sure that our categorical are represented in numeric manner. Therefore, all categorical variables will be converted to factors. # Categorical variables to factors x[c(&quot;Partner&quot;,&quot;Dependents&quot;,&quot;PhoneService&quot;,&quot;gender&quot;,&quot;MultipleLines&quot;,&quot;InternetService&quot;,&quot;OnlineSecurity&quot;,&quot;OnlineBackup&quot;,&quot;DeviceProtection&quot;,&quot;TechSupport&quot;,&quot;StreamingTV&quot;,&quot;Contract&quot;,&quot;StreamingMovies&quot;,&quot;PaperlessBilling&quot;,&quot;PaymentMethod&quot;,&quot;Churn&quot;)]&lt;-lapply(x[c(&quot;Partner&quot;,&quot;Dependents&quot;,&quot;PhoneService&quot;,&quot;gender&quot;,&quot;MultipleLines&quot;,&quot;InternetService&quot;,&quot;OnlineSecurity&quot;,&quot;OnlineBackup&quot;,&quot;DeviceProtection&quot;,&quot;TechSupport&quot;,&quot;StreamingTV&quot;,&quot;Contract&quot;,&quot;StreamingMovies&quot;,&quot;PaperlessBilling&quot;,&quot;PaymentMethod&quot;,&quot;Churn&quot;)], as.factor) str(x) ## &#39;data.frame&#39;: 7032 obs. of 21 variables: ## $ customerID : chr &quot;7590-VHVEG&quot; &quot;5575-GNVDE&quot; &quot;3668-QPYBK&quot; &quot;7795-CFOCW&quot; ... ## $ gender : Factor w/ 2 levels &quot;Female&quot;,&quot;Male&quot;: 1 2 2 2 1 1 2 1 1 2 ... ## $ SeniorCitizen : int 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ... ## $ Partner : Factor w/ 2 levels &quot;No&quot;,&quot;Yes&quot;: 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 ... ## $ Dependents : Factor w/ 2 levels &quot;No&quot;,&quot;Yes&quot;: 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 2 ... ## $ tenure : int 1 34 2 45 2 8 22 10 28 62 ... ## $ PhoneService : Factor w/ 2 levels &quot;No&quot;,&quot;Yes&quot;: 1 2 2 1 2 2 2 1 2 2 ... ## $ MultipleLines : Factor w/ 3 levels &quot;No&quot;,&quot;No phone service&quot;,..: 2 1 1 2 1 3 3 2 3 1 ... ## $ InternetService : Factor w/ 3 levels &quot;DSL&quot;,&quot;Fiber optic&quot;,..: 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 1 2 1 ... ## $ OnlineSecurity : Factor w/ 3 levels &quot;No&quot;,&quot;No internet service&quot;,..: 1 3 3 3 1 1 1 3 1 3 ... ## $ OnlineBackup : Factor w/ 3 levels &quot;No&quot;,&quot;No internet service&quot;,..: 3 1 3 1 1 1 3 1 1 3 ... ## $ DeviceProtection: Factor w/ 3 levels &quot;No&quot;,&quot;No internet service&quot;,..: 1 3 1 3 1 3 1 1 3 1 ... ## $ TechSupport : Factor w/ 3 levels &quot;No&quot;,&quot;No internet service&quot;,..: 1 1 1 3 1 1 1 1 3 1 ... ## $ StreamingTV : Factor w/ 3 levels &quot;No&quot;,&quot;No internet service&quot;,..: 1 1 1 1 1 3 3 1 3 1 ... ## $ StreamingMovies : Factor w/ 3 levels &quot;No&quot;,&quot;No internet service&quot;,..: 1 1 1 1 1 3 1 1 3 1 ... ## $ Contract : Factor w/ 3 levels &quot;Month-to-month&quot;,..: 1 2 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 2 ... ## $ PaperlessBilling: Factor w/ 2 levels &quot;No&quot;,&quot;Yes&quot;: 2 1 2 1 2 2 2 1 2 1 ... ## $ PaymentMethod : Factor w/ 4 levels &quot;Bank transfer (automatic)&quot;,..: 3 4 4 1 3 3 2 4 3 1 ... ## $ MonthlyCharges : num 29.9 57 53.9 42.3 70.7 ... ## $ TotalCharges : num 29.9 1889.5 108.2 1840.8 151.7 ... ## $ Churn : Factor w/ 2 levels &quot;No&quot;,&quot;Yes&quot;: 1 1 2 1 2 2 1 1 2 1 ... We aim to convert our data set into matrix with only 0s and 1s. Thus, all binomial variables can be turned to 0s and 1s in the following way: # Binomial categorical variables to 0 and 1 x$PhoneService &lt;- as.numeric(x$PhoneService)-1 x$Partner &lt;-as.numeric(x$Partner)-1 x$Dependents &lt;- as.numeric(x$Dependents)-1 x$Churn &lt;- as.numeric(x$Churn)-1 x$gender &lt;- as.numeric(x$gender)-1 Now it is left to convert multi-class variables 0s and 1s. Before we do it, lets inspect our data a bit: ## Categorical variables with more than 2 categories par(mfrow=c(5,2)) # Multiple lines ggplot(x, aes(MultipleLines,fill=MultipleLines)) + geom_bar() + labs(title=&quot;Multiple lines&quot;,x=&quot;&quot;,y=&quot;Count&quot;) # Internet services ggplot(x, aes(InternetService,fill=InternetService)) + geom_bar() + labs(title=&quot;Internet service&quot;,x=&quot;&quot;,y=&quot;Count&quot;) # OnlineSecurity ggplot(x, aes(OnlineSecurity,fill=OnlineSecurity)) + geom_bar() + labs(title=&quot;OnlineSecurity&quot;,x=&quot;&quot;,y=&quot;Count&quot;) # OnlineBackup ggplot(x, aes(OnlineBackup,fill=OnlineBackup)) + geom_bar() + labs(title=&quot;OnlineBackup&quot;,x=&quot;&quot;,y=&quot;Count&quot;) # DeviceProtection ggplot(x, aes(DeviceProtection,fill=DeviceProtection)) + geom_bar() + labs(title=&quot;DeviceProtection&quot;,x=&quot;&quot;,y=&quot;Count&quot;) # TechSupport ggplot(x, aes(TechSupport,fill=TechSupport)) + geom_bar() + labs(title=&quot;TechSupport&quot;,x=&quot;&quot;,y=&quot;Count&quot;) # StreamingTV ggplot(x, aes(StreamingTV,fill=StreamingTV)) + geom_bar() + labs(title=&quot;StreamingTV&quot;,x=&quot;&quot;,y=&quot;Count&quot;) # StreamingMovies ggplot(x, aes(StreamingMovies,fill=StreamingMovies)) + geom_bar() + labs(title=&quot;StreamingMovies&quot;,x=&quot;&quot;,y=&quot;Count&quot;) # Contract ggplot(x, aes(Contract,fill=Contract)) + geom_bar() + labs(title=&quot;Contract&quot;,x=&quot;&quot;,y=&quot;Count&quot;) # PaymentMethod ggplot(x, aes(PaymentMethod,fill=PaymentMethod)) + geom_bar() + labs(title=&quot;PaymentMethod&quot;,x=&quot;&quot;,y=&quot;Count&quot;) We can apply one hot encoding to our data set by using Rs base function model.matrix. In the code below, ~.+0 leads to encoding of all categorical variables without producing an intercept. # One-hot encoding x.mat&lt;- model.matrix(~MultipleLines+InternetService+OnlineSecurity+OnlineBackup+DeviceProtection+TechSupport+StreamingTV+Contract+StreamingMovies+PaperlessBilling+PaymentMethod+0,data = x) Now is our data set pre-processed: # Creation of the final data frame with 0s and 1s final.df&lt;-as.data.frame(x.mat) final.df&lt;- cbind(x.mat,x$tenure,x$TotalCharges,x$MonthlyCharges,x$PhoneService,x$Partner,x$Dependents,x$gender,x$Churn) colnames(final.df)[24:31]&lt;-c(&quot;tenure&quot;,&quot;TotalCharges&quot;,&quot;MonthlyCharges&quot;,&quot;PhoneService&quot;,&quot;Partner&quot;,&quot;Dependents&quot;,&quot;gender&quot;,&quot;Churn&quot;) 5.4 Data partition Now we need to split our data into test and train data. The proportion is 70:30. # Creation of training and test data sets index &lt;- caret::createDataPartition(x$Churn, p = 0.7, list = F) train &lt;- final.df[index,] test &lt;- final.df[-index,] # Partitioning test data x_test &lt;- as.matrix(test[,-31]) y_test &lt;- as.matrix(test[,31]) # Partitioning train data x_train &lt;- as.matrix(train[,-31]) y_train &lt;- as.matrix(train[,31]) To train our random forest model we use function randomForest(). At this point we will not aim to fine tune our model, so we will define just two parameters,ntree and maxnodes: ntree defines the number of trees to build in the forest. maxnodes defines the maximum number of terminal nodes each tree in the forest can have. 5.5 Random Forest model # Random Forest # Training library(randomForest) rfModel &lt;- randomForest(x=x_train, y=factor(y_train), ntree=500, maxnodes=24) Since predictions are made based on features our model was trained on, it is possible to observe importance of each feature. The more important a feature, the greater influence it exerts on predictions: importance_features &lt;- randomForest::importance(rfModel) importance_features &lt;- as.data.frame(importance_features) importance_features$features &lt;- row.names(importance_features) importance_features &lt;- importance_features[order(importance_features$MeanDecreaseGini ,decreasing = TRUE),] library(plotly) p&lt;-ggplot(importance_features) + geom_point(aes(reorder(features,MeanDecreaseGini),MeanDecreaseGini),stat = &quot;identity&quot;)+ theme_minimal()+ coord_flip()+ labs(title=&quot;Important features&quot;,x=&quot;Features&quot;) ggplotly(p) As we can see from this output, the tenure feature seems to be the most important factor in making the final prediction. Factors such as InternetServiceFiber optic,TotalCharges and ContractTwo year come subsequently. 5.6 Evaluating Model In order to evaluate our model we will take a look at accuracy, precision and recall. # Evaluating Models prediction_insample &lt;- as.double(predict(rfModel, x_train)) - 1 prediction_outsample &lt;- as.double(predict(rfModel, x_test)) - 1 Accuracy is the percentage of correct predictions out of all predictions. # Accuracy accu_insample &lt;- mean(y_train == prediction_insample) accu_outsample &lt;- mean(y_test == prediction_outsample) print(sprintf(&#39;In-Sample Accuracy: %0.4f&#39;, accu_insample)) ## [1] &quot;In-Sample Accuracy: 0.8009&quot; print(sprintf(&#39;Out-Sample Accuracy: %0.4f&#39;, accu_outsample)) ## [1] &quot;Out-Sample Accuracy: 0.7857&quot; We managed to achieve pretty good out-sample accuracy even without thorough fine-tuning our parameters. Precision is the number of true positives divided by the total number of true positives and false positives. # Precision prec_insample &lt;- sum(prediction_insample &amp; y_train) / sum(prediction_insample) prec_outsample &lt;- sum(prediction_outsample &amp; y_test) / sum(prediction_outsample) print(sprintf(&#39;In-Sample Precision: %0.4f&#39;, prec_insample)) ## [1] &quot;In-Sample Precision: 0.6952&quot; print(sprintf(&#39;Out-Sample Precision: %0.4f&#39;, prec_outsample)) ## [1] &quot;Out-Sample Precision: 0.6918&quot; Recall is defined as the number of true positives divided by number of true positives plus false negatives. # Recall recall_insample &lt;- sum(prediction_insample &amp; y_train) / sum(y_train) recall_outsample &lt;- sum(prediction_outsample &amp; y_test) / sum(y_test) print(sprintf(&#39;In-Sample Recall: %0.4f&#39;, recall_insample)) ## [1] &quot;In-Sample Recall: 0.4332&quot; print(sprintf(&#39;Out-Sample Recall: %0.4f&#39;, recall_outsample)) ## [1] &quot;Out-Sample Recall: 0.3833&quot; Finally, in order to estimate how good our model is in comparison to the random prediction, we will inspect ROC curve and the Area Under the Curve. library(ROCR) pred_prob_insample &lt;- as.double(predict(rfModel, x_train, type=&#39;prob&#39;)[,2]) pred_prob_outsample &lt;- as.double(predict(rfModel, x_test, type=&#39;prob&#39;)[,2]) pred &lt;- prediction(pred_prob_outsample, y_test) perf &lt;- performance(pred, measure = &quot;tpr&quot;, x.measure = &quot;fpr&quot;) auc &lt;- performance(pred, measure=&#39;auc&#39;)@y.values[[1]] {plot(perf,main=sprintf(&#39;Random Forest (AUC: %0.2f)&#39;, auc),col=&#39;darkblue&#39;,lwd=2) + grid() abline(a = 0, b = 1, col=&#39;darkgray&#39;, lty=4, lwd=2)} 5.7 References Hwang, Y.

Based on some studies it has been proven that personalized product recommendations drive 24% of the orders and 26% of the revenue. This explains the influence recommendation has on volume of orders and generally on sales figures. What is more, it has been proven that product recommendations lead to reoccurring visits and that purchases on recommendation mark higher average-order value. Consequently, we decided to use method called user-based collaborative filtering to build our recommendation system (Reference). First, we proceed with data preparation and pre-processing, then we build our recommender system, and finally draw business implications. 6.2 Data collection As we earlier mentioned, we use data on Amazon customer reviews of beauty products. The data used in this project can be accessed in this link. It contains the following features: Product price: price of the product Product Id: ASIN number of a product on Amazon. Product title: title of the product Review helpfulness: fraction of users who found the review helpful Profile Name: name of the user Review score: rating of the product Review summary: concise summary of the review text Review text Review time Review userId 6.3 Data preparation and preprocessing 6.3.1 Packages #Packages library(R.utils) library(dplyr) library(tidyr) library(janitor) library(recommenderlab) library(tm) library(NLP) library(qdap) library(readr) library(wordcloud) 6.3.2 Data loading and inspecting After downloading data locally we load in data by usingreadLines() function: # Loading in data my_data &lt;- readRDS(&quot;data/amazon_beauty_full.RDS&quot;) Let us first have a look at the dimension of our data. Our data set is currently in a form of a single vector with 2772616 elements. Obviously, this is not the optimal form of the data we would like to work with. That is why we need to work around this data set to make it more convenient for further analysis. What we can do first is to remove all fields with no characters: my_data &lt;- my_data[sapply(my_data, nchar) &gt; 0] Then we can convert it to data frame: my_data &lt;- as.data.frame(my_data) colnames(my_data) &lt;- &quot;product&quot; One of the critical steps is separating the column to multiple columns: # Separate one column to two (&quot;:&quot; separator) my_data &lt;- separate(my_data,col = product, into = c(&quot;Info&quot;,&quot;Product&quot;), sep = &quot;:&quot;) Inspecting first 10 values: head(my_data,10) ## Info ## 1 product/productId ## 2 product/title ## 3 product/price ## 4 review/userId ## 5 review/profileName ## 6 review/helpfulness ## 7 review/score ## 8 review/time ## 9 review/summary ## 10 review/text ## Product ## 1 B00064C0IU ## 2 Oscar Eau de Toilette for Women by Oscar de La Renta ## 3 24.19 ## 4 A1FWT811DSZLC8 ## 5 Heidi M ## 6 0/0 ## 7 3.0 ## 8 1360368000 ## 9 doesn&#39;t last ## 10 very light scent that doesn&#39;t last very long. pretty bottle but I was hoping for more of a freesia scent. which it was not. The data set is loaded in .txt format, which makes it a bit challenging to work with. In the following sections we will undertake data manipulation in order to bring the data set in more suitable form. First, we will convert it from the current long-format to the wide-format, where each column will represent a product, and each row a feature: #Converting long format to wide my_data &lt;- my_data %&gt;% group_by(Info) %&gt;% mutate(Order = seq_along(Info)) %&gt;% spread(key = Order, value = Product) Since the column names are labeled with numbers, we will apply first row as a label for the corresponding column name: my_data &lt;- as.data.frame(t(my_data)) my_data&lt;-my_data%&gt;% row_to_names(row_number = 1) Delete rows with at least 1 NAs: my_data &lt;- my_data[rowSums(is.na(my_data))==0,] Trim white space at the beginning or ending the string: my_data$`review/userId`&lt;- trimws(my_data$`review/userId`) my_data$`product/productId`&lt;- trimws(my_data$`product/productId`) my_data$`product/price`&lt;- trimws(my_data$`product/price`) my_data$`product/title`&lt;- trimws(my_data$`product/title`) Filtering out reviews with unknown userID and productId: my_data&lt;-filter(my_data,`review/userId`!=&quot;unknown&quot; &amp; `product/productId`!=&quot;unknown&quot; &amp; `product/price`!=&quot;unknown&quot;) Correcting column classes: my_data$`product/productId` &lt;- as.factor(my_data$`product/productId`) my_data$`review/score`&lt;- as.numeric(my_data$`review/score`) my_data$`review/userId`&lt;-as.factor(my_data$`review/userId`) my_data$`product/price`&lt;-as.numeric(my_data$`product/price`) 6.3.3 How many times users reviewed products? In order to use relevant data, we would need to define the minimum number of reviews per user. Since majority of users left only one review. Therefore, we will remove all single-review users and all other users who left less then 2 reviews. Filtering out users who left 2 or more reviews: freq&lt;-as.data.frame(table(my_data$`review/userId`)) index&lt;-filter(freq, freq$Freq&gt;=1)$Var1 We are now left with 1316 users who reviewed certain beauty product at least 2 times. my_data &lt;- subset(my_data,`review/userId` %in% index) 6.3.4 Exploratory data analysis 6.3.4.1 Head of data head(my_data) ## product/price product/productId ## 1 24.19 B00064C0IU ## 2 24.19 B00064C0IU ## 3 24.19 B00064C0IU ## 4 24.19 B00064C0IU ## 5 5.99 B000K5JBZU ## 6 5.99 B000K5JBZU ## product/title ## 1 Oscar Eau de Toilette for Women by Oscar de La Renta ## 2 Oscar Eau de Toilette for Women by Oscar de La Renta ## 3 Oscar Eau de Toilette for Women by Oscar de La Renta ## 4 Oscar Eau de Toilette for Women by Oscar de La Renta ## 5 Optimum Care Anti-Breakage Therapy Moisture Replenish Cream Hairdress ## 6 Optimum Care Anti-Breakage Therapy Moisture Replenish Cream Hairdress ## review/helpfulness review/profileName review/score ## 1 0/0 Heidi M 3 ## 2 0/0 Donna Mpaulin &quot;PURPLE RAVEN&quot; 5 ## 3 0/0 M.

Smells nothing like freesia.The gift recipient was not impressed. The worst is that it can&#39;t be returned! ## 4 This was a gift for my sister. It wowed her. She has always worn Freesia but typically can only find it in body lotion or such. This product really thrilled her, a nice perfume in her favorite scent with a beautiful package. ## 5 I have been using this product for a couple years now. I started using it because my hair had gotten so dry from all the chemical treatments and relaxers. This actualy came in the relaxer kit. I tried it and could not beleive the difference it made with one use. I could not find it in any of the stores at the time so I searched Amazon and they had it. I absolutely love it. It is the best moisturizing product I have used so far. My hair is soft with good elasticity and it is not breaking anywhere close to what it was. I am very happy with it. ## 6 I Tried this product in the past and fell in love with it. I could not find it for some time and am now very pleased that I was abe to find it again here on amazon.

Smells nothing like freesia.The gift recipient was not impressed. The worst is that it can&#39;t be returned! ## 4 This was a gift for my sister. It wowed her. She has always worn Freesia but typically can only find it in body lotion or such. This product really thrilled her, a nice perfume in her favorite scent with a beautiful package. ## 5 I have been using this product for a couple years now. I started using it because my hair had gotten so dry from all the chemical treatments and relaxers. This actualy came in the relaxer kit. I tried it and could not beleive the difference it made with one use. I could not find it in any of the stores at the time so I searched Amazon and they had it. I absolutely love it. It is the best moisturizing product I have used so far. My hair is soft with good elasticity and it is not breaking anywhere close to what it was. I am very happy with it. ## 6 I Tried this product in the past and fell in love with it. I could not find it for some time and am now very pleased that I was abe to find it again here on amazon. It smoothes the hair and faciltate ease in removing tangles. ## review/time review/userId ## 1 1360368000 A1FWT811DSZLC8 ## 2 1358467200 A1THE6V6O8ROD4 ## 3 1357084800 A176IQ7MVD3N6T ## 4 1326240000 A34BDX4JVMG23Y ## 5 1351987200 A3UWJXJI7S3T05 ## 6 1360972800 A1QAXWETH56D6J 6.4.2 Subsetting data In order to model a recommender system, three variables in our case are of great importance: User ID Product ID Score / Rating Our model will be based on these three variables. Additionally, we will make use of the remaining features by utilizing some text mining techniques, but you will find more details at some later point. Now, we will make a subset of our data with 3 mentioned variables: subset_my_data &lt;- subset(my_data, select = c(`review/userId`,`product/productId`,`review/score`)) head(subset_my_data) ## review/userId product/productId review/score ## 1 A1FWT811DSZLC8 B00064C0IU 3 ## 2 A1THE6V6O8ROD4 B00064C0IU 5 ## 3 A176IQ7MVD3N6T B00064C0IU 1 ## 4 A34BDX4JVMG23Y B00064C0IU 5 ## 5 A3UWJXJI7S3T05 B000K5JBZU 5 ## 6 A1QAXWETH56D6J B000K5JBZU 5 Let us inspect the dimensions: dim(subset_my_data) ## [1] 8581 3 6.4.3 Formatting data Our data is currently in the long format, i.e. one row for one rating. However, we would want to get a matrix with ratings where the rows represent the users IDs and the columns the Product IDs. Thus, we will transform our data to so called rating matrix: ratings &lt;- as(subset_my_data, &quot;realRatingMatrix&quot;) In order to avoid high/low rating bias from users who give high (or low) ratings to all the products they reviewed, we will need to normalize our data. That would prevent certain bias in the results. ratings &lt;- normalize(ratings) 6.4.4 Inspecting real rating matrix We can plot an image of the rating matrix for the first 250 users and 250 products: image(ratings[1:250,1:250]) From the visualisation we can see that rating matrix is very sparse, i.e. that not every user did rate/review every product in our data set. We can inspect the data for the first 10 users and the first 4 products: ratings[1:10, 1:4]@data ## 10 x 4 sparse Matrix of class &quot;dgCMatrix&quot; ## B000052Z5B B000052Z5L B000052Z5M B000052Z89 ## A00275441WYR3489IKNAB . . . . ## A0353671240B3B6L8WKZB . . . . ## A0793784FP3F6ZXZDTN6 . . . . ## A10013UITIMJVI . . . . ## A1008GFLTBL76H . . . . ## A100VLYGYI6FXY . . . . ## A100W0JWG5GB6G . . . . ## A1016Z89IM29SK . . . . ## A102NKLXRT5KEM . . . . ## A102U9TVYZC0DX . . . . As we already saw in the visualisation, the data is sparse and the first 10 users did not review first 4 products visualised in the matrix above. 6.4.5 Building a recommender Finally, we will now build our recommendation system based on User-based collaborative filtering User-based collaborative filtering search for similar users and gives them recommendations based on what other users with similar rating patterns appreciated: recommender &lt;- Recommender(ratings, method=&quot;UBCF&quot;) recommender ## Recommender of type &#39;UBCF&#39; for &#39;realRatingMatrix&#39; ## learned using 8002 users. Additionally, in order to compare results of two methods, we would like to apply item-based collaborative filtering method to build another recommender system. In contrast to user-based collaborative filtering, item-based collaborative filtering looks for similarity patterns between items and recommends them to users based on the computed information. recommenderIBCF &lt;- Recommender(ratings, method=&quot;IBCF&quot;) recommenderIBCF ## Recommender of type &#39;IBCF&#39; for &#39;realRatingMatrix&#39; ## learned using 8002 users. As reported, both recommendation systems are built using 8002 users. 6.5 Interpretation and managerial implications Now we would like to interpret the output of our recommender systems. First we start with UBCF-based recommender system. current.user &lt;- 45 recommendations &lt;- predict(recommender, current.user, data = ratings, n = 5) We decided to take user number 45 and inspect 5 recommendations provided to him/her. Now we can inspect what our recommendation system provided in the end: str(recommendations) ## Formal class &#39;topNList&#39; [package &quot;recommenderlab&quot;] with 4 slots ## ..@ items :List of 1 ## .. ..$ A10N19OL0CKYDV: int [1:2] 173 772 ## ..@ ratings :List of 1 ## .. ..$ A10N19OL0CKYDV: num [1:2] 5 5 ## ..@ itemLabels: chr [1:928] &quot;B000052Z5B&quot; &quot;B000052Z5L&quot; &quot;B000052Z5M&quot; &quot;B000052Z89&quot; ... ## ..@ n : int 5 We can see that the user ID of the user number 45 is A10N19OL0CKYDV. Our system found 2 products to recommend to this user, and we can find product index (173, 772) as well as ratings that the system calculated from the ratings of the closest users (5,5). Let us create a prediction made by IBCF-based recommender: recommendationsIBCF &lt;- predict(recommenderIBCF,current.user,data = ratings, n=5) str(recommendationsIBCF) ## Formal class &#39;topNList&#39; [package &quot;recommenderlab&quot;] with 4 slots ## ..@ items :List of 1 ## .. ..$ A10N19OL0CKYDV: int(0) ## ..@ ratings :List of 1 ## .. ..$ A10N19OL0CKYDV: num(0) ## ..@ itemLabels: chr [1:928] &quot;B000052Z5B&quot; &quot;B000052Z5L&quot; &quot;B000052Z5M&quot; &quot;B000052Z89&quot; ... ## ..@ n : int 5 We will inspect potential recommended products: head(as(recommendationsIBCF,&quot;list&quot;)) ## $A10N19OL0CKYDV ## character(0) Unfortunately, our item-based collaborative filtering system did not generate any recommendation for the user number 45. 6.5.1 Identification of the recommended products Let us now identify the products recommended by UBCF-based recommender. First we need to extract the index of the recommended products: index&lt;- as.vector(as.factor(unlist(as(recommendations, &quot;list&quot;)))) Then we find corresponding product in our initial data set: (recommendation_26&lt;-my_data[match(index, my_data$`product/productId`),]) ## product/price product/productId ## 6952 4.97 B00027EG9C ## 4190 0.01 B000NCQK68 ## product/title review/helpfulness ## 6952 Neutrogena Fresh Foaming Cleanser, 6.7 Ounce 0/0 ## 4190 Revlon ColorSilk Beautiful Color Hair Coloring Products 10/11 ## review/profileName review/score review/summary ## 6952 armicat 4 I love it! ## 4190 Grace M. 4 Pretty good ## review/text ## 6952 Neutrogena Fresh Foaming Cleanser is really good! I am using everyday, I can recommend this item to my friends. But the problem is packaging was bad. ## 4190 I&#39;ve had black/blue-black hair for a while now, and have become somewhat of an expert in the field of cheap-o boxed drugstore hair color. I keep coming back to this color! I was suspicious at first to be honest because its SO cheap, I figured my hair would fall out or turn an ugly color... but I tried it anyway. I have long, super thick hair but there was enough dye to get everything - no streaks. It lasts the longest out of any boxed hair color I&#39;ve tried and it looks SO good!OK, yeah, it comes with cheap crappy gloves and the world&#39;s smallest packet of conditioner, but those are minor issues. You can get 50 pairs of latex gloves at rite-aid for 2 bucks (a good idea anyway so you dont have to keep reusing the dirty color-stained gloves from the box) and if you don&#39;t already have conditioner to supplement the conditioner in the box, you shouldn&#39;t be dying your hair anyway.The only drawback I&#39;ve experienced is the color DOES run when I wash it and I have definitely stained my bath towels/pillowcase a few times. It could be something I&#39;m doing wrong though... ## review/time review/userId ## 6952 1361232000 A3HUAIQVMNXGKL ## 4190 1308700800 A1DBAOA82KSVND Two products recommended are : Neutrogena Fresh Foaming Cleanser, 6.7 Ounce - facial cleansing cream Revlon ColorSilk Beautiful Color Hair Coloring Products - color for hair Let us now inspect products that the user A10N19OL0CKYDV rated: my_data[match(&quot;A10N19OL0CKYDV&quot;,my_data$`review/userId`),] ## product/price product/productId product/title review/helpfulness ## 1913 1.89 B000NGLR62 Opi Ridge Filler .5 oz. 0/0 ## review/profileName review/score review/summary ## 1913 Erica 4 Great Base Coat ## review/text ## 1913 I got this as a base coat, and for that purpose it works really well. It&#39;s easy to apply (the brush is easy to use) and dries to a matte, translucent white coat. Nail polish glides smoothly over it, just as I was expecting. It protects my nails from dark polishes and prevents my nails from chipping easily. I&#39;m unsure of how different it is than other regular base coats, but I really like and recommend this product. ## review/time review/userId ## 1913 1356912000 A10N19OL0CKYDV 6.5.2 Implications As we could see, this user reviewed only one product, called Opi Ridge Filler .5 oz., and it is a nail-care product. We could assume that this person is a female user since the product she bought is typically associated with female beauty care. What is more, two recommended products are as well very strongly associated to being typical female beauty products. Finally, we have the name of the user (Erica), so we can be sure that the user is a female. From the qualitative perspective it seems that our recommendation system provides descent recommendations!. 6.6 Bonus analysis: Text Mining In addition to our recommender system, we will apply some basic text mining techniques to explore reviews text. Text mining helps us to mine opinions of users (in this case) about the reviewed products at scale. 6.6.1 Wordcloud Here we create a wordcloud of words from product reviews of recommended products to the user 45. Beforehand we would need to pre-process the text of reviews in the following manner: # Split text into parts using new line character: text.docs &lt;- Corpus(VectorSource(recommendation_26$`review/text`)) toSpace &lt;- content_transformer(function (x , pattern ) gsub(pattern, &quot; &quot;, x)) text.docs &lt;- tm_map(text.docs, toSpace, &quot;/&quot;) text.docs &lt;- tm_map(text.docs, toSpace, &quot;@&quot;) text.docs &lt;- tm_map(text.docs, toSpace, &quot;\\\\|&quot;) text.docs &lt;- tm_map(text.docs, content_transformer(tolower)) text.docs &lt;- tm_map(text.docs, removeNumbers) text.docs &lt;- tm_map(text.docs, stripWhitespace) text.docs &lt;- tm_map(text.docs, removeWords, stopwords(&quot;english&quot;)) text.docs &lt;- tm_map(text.docs, removePunctuation) dtm &lt;- DocumentTermMatrix(text.docs, control=list(weighting=weightTf)) m &lt;- as.matrix(t(dtm)) v &lt;- sort(rowSums(m),decreasing=TRUE) d &lt;- data.frame(word = names(v),freq=v) set.seed(1234) wordcloud(words = d$word, freq = d$freq, min.freq = 10, max.words=200, random.order=FALSE, rot.per=0.35, colors=brewer.pal(8, &quot;Dark2&quot;)) From the wordcloud we can see that words color, hair and gloves are quite frequent in the text corpus analyzed. That could be a hint that the user was referring to the usage of the product. The term cheap could be easily spotted as well. This word is not very likable among marketers as it brings unfavorable image to the brand. Nevertheless, it seems that the user believes that the product is affordable. 6.7 Future work This data set provides multiple possibility for the further analysis besides recommender systems. Here are some ideas what can be further done: Sentiment analysis - Sentiment analysis can be done and scores (typically from -3 to +3) accompanied to each review description. That would tell us more about the sentiment that users have about the products reviewed. Prediction of ratings - In case that we would have enough data (ratings) about one product, regardless of customers, it would be possible to develop a machine learning model which based on current features (e.g. price) and additional features (such as sentiment or words in the review) could predict the rating that one product might have. Prediction of the sentiment - in the similar manner as the previous point, it would be useful to train a machine learning model to predict a sentiment that would hypotetically emerge in a reviewer. Topic modeling - topic modeling is unsupervised machine learning technique that could help us identify topics which users discuss in the text of reviews. 6.8 Limitations Limitation related to this data set and building a recommender system is the fact that the majority of users have left only one review: table(as.data.frame(table(my_data$`review/userId`))$Freq) ## ## 1 2 3 4 5 6 9 10 37 ## 7638 259 58 30 9 5 1 1 1 Let us take a look which users left the most reviews: limitations &lt;-as.data.frame(table(my_data$`review/userId`)) limitations %&gt;% arrange(desc(Freq))%&gt;%rename(UserID=Var1)%&gt;% head() ## UserID Freq ## 1 A3M174IC0VXOS2 37 ## 2 A3KEZLJ59C1JVH 10 ## 3 A3QEE0ZPMT3W6P 9 ## 4 A281NPSIMI1C2R 6 ## 5 A2D4GHWUW440K3 6 ## 6 A2FJZE9Y420X77 6 We can see that users under IDs A3M174IC0VXOS2,A3KEZLJ59C1JVH,A3QEE0ZPMT3W6P are rare examples of users who left multiple product reviews.
